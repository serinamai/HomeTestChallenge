Automation challenges
------------
Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Java version: 1.8
- Gradle version: 6.8.3
- Platform: Windows 10, Mac OS X
- Support browser:
     + Chrome: version 88
     + Firefox: version 86


### How to execution

Open the terminal of IDE tool, then type `gradle test` and the tests will be executed.

In order to change the number of threads, in `build.gradle` file, change the number set at `Ddataproviderthreadcount`

For example: We want to execute with 2 threads, then `jvmArgs(["-Ddataproviderthreadcount=2"])`

### How to modify the execution

1. Delegated feature file: Set features in nested `@CucumberOptions`

For example:
- Run delegated UI feature file: `features = {"src/test/resources/UTestStepDefinition.feature"}`

2. Nominate browser: Change the browser set in global.properties file
Location: `TrialSeleniumFW/src/main/java/Properties/global.properties`

It could be set into CHROME, chrome, FIREFOX, firefox

### How to get report file

As the current designed framework, each report file contains one scenario. It supports adding a test log in each test run in the Test Management tool.
Report folder: `TrialSeleniumFW/src/main/java/Reports`


### Structure of Source code
Feature file -> Step definition -> Page Object -> Selenium Wrapper

1. Feature file: it contains all scenarios of feature in Gherkin steps. Location: `TrialSeleniumFW/src/test/resources`

2. Step Definition: it contains all methods defined under Gherkin steps. Location: `TrialSeleniumFW/src/test/java/StepDefinitions`

3. Page Object: located all By locators at the top of page and all methods interacted with them. It extends from Selenium Wrapper. Location: `TrialSeleniumFW/src/main/java/Pages`

4. Selenium Wrapper: wrap up all selenium actions with Try - catch and Report which log info. It is necessary when debugging.

P/s: In case, you are using the IntelliJ for execution, then you encounter the error `Test events were not received`, please refer this link (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57795263/test-events-were-not-received-when-run-tests-using-intellij). Hopefully it could help to fix it.
